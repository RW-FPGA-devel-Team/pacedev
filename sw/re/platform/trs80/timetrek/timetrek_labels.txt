# You'll see "srs_line1" referenced quite a bit.  Many routines use it to tell
# if the short range scan is up.  If the high bit is set, it is a graphics character
# indicating that the short range scan is active.

# I'm making a small leap, but I'd say that the quadrant map is at 4000h
# which is practically always pointed to by IX.  Of course, 4000h is generally
# a "zero page" area.  And very often "DE" points there (i.e., D has 40h).
# Quite a bit of code where (IX+43) (current quadrant) is put into E thereby
# making it so (DE) contains the information on that quadrant.
# Each quadrant is a single byte with each bit denoting what it contains:
#
#  bit 0   - starbase
#  bit 1+2 - count of 0 to 3 klingons (4055 - 4057 is their positions in the quadrant)
#  bit 3+4 - count of 2 to 5 stars (4050 - 4054 is their positions in the quadrant)
#  bit 5   - black hole in quadrant
#  bit 6   - magnetic storm in quadrant
#
#
# XXX - pos_klingons is off by one 'cause I think stars go from 2 to 5.  And there's
# the black hole after the klingons at 4058, I think.
# Yes, I've seen 5 stars so I should adjust
#
# The table ends at 403f as there are 64 quadrants in an 8 x 8 map

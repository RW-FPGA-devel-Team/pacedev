INSTRUCTIONS
The game Knightlore is set in a dark castle where you, the
sabreman have to rid yourself from the curse of the werewolf. 
The only way to do this is to find 6 objects and drop them into
the wizard`s cauldron to create a remedy.  The games gimmic, and
arguably it`s selling point, was it`s forced 3D isometric
perspective that gave the rooms a more realistic look.

The inlay card doesn`t actually HAVE any instructions, just lots
of riddles.  As with all Ultimate games, the user had to use his
brain to work out what to do.  The object of the game is for you
to first find the wizard of the castle and enter the room he is
in when you are in your sabreman form. Out of the cauldron an
item will appear.  Your mission is to then hunt out this object
and place it into the cauldron.  Once this has been done, another
object that you will have to search out and return will appear. 
Once you have done this 6 times you will have ridden the
werewolf`s curse from your body.  Be quick! You only have 40 days
and nights to complete the spell.


INLAY CARD TEXT

THE WEREWULF

My journey`s end is near; as the last few ebbs of daylight dance
fleetingly in the cooling twilight, and then suddenly dart off
to chase the red sinking sun.

Behind me I feel night`s dark icy fingers slither up long looming
shadows, hiding behind large mounds and boulders, watching my
every move... silently waiting...

For days I have journeyed from the realms of the junglewulf to
"KNIGHT LORE" castle to seek the old dying wizard and ask for his
help to free me from this deathly curse... For countless nights
I have slept chained to tress to keep my deathly curse at bay,
but now I am here...

My footsteps echo around the damp mossy walls of the large
chamber, as I enter through the open main gateway, colossal doors
judder open in an untouched groaning symphony, beckoning me
forward on my quest.

I sense the old wizard`s gaze playing upon me, encapsulated
within the labyrinth of traps and tests, to keep out all but the
most persistent of unwanted guests who seek an audience with the
great wizard MELKHIOR.

Suddenly a cool blue mist starts to ebb forth from the cracks in
the ancient stone-work. As it does so it begins to take form and
become a powerful swimming swirling vortex of energy.

Over all the noise can be heard the chanting and singing of long
forgotten tunes, all sung in a blur of forgetfulness.

THE MIST TUNES

THE WIZARD`S OLDER NOW THAN ALL
HIS HELP YOU SEEK WITHIN THIS WALL
FOR FORTY DAYS YOUR QUEST MAY LAST
LOCATE THE POTION, MAKE IT FAST
THIS HIDEOUS SPELL UPON YOUR SOUL
TO LOSE ITS HOLD MUST BE YOUR GOAL
BEWARE, THE TRAPS FROM HERE BEGIN
THE CAULDRON TELLS WHAT MUST GO IN
TO BREAK THE CURSE AND MAKE THE SPELL
TO SAVE YOURSELF AND MAKE YOU WELL.

The mist suddenly ceases its action and dissipates as quickly as
it came. I drop to the floor and with full knowledge of the old
wizard I begin my quest.  Dimly lit tortches light the massive
stone walls, their tired flickering flames never seeming to
penetrate the inky darkness for more than a few feet... 
crystaline Merkyls, hideous Hobgoblins, stand frozen on huge
monoliths, glittering in the cool trembling moonlight. 
Encapsulated by the old wizard long ago, they await their fate
in an un-ending task of defence, silent and stoney.  This is to
be their last everlasting fate as guardians of KNIGHTLORE castle,
until the ultimate death of the old sorcerer...  The moon has
risen quickly and in the fulless of its cool blue light, I become
a Werewulf...  My fate is now all too clear, I have but forty
days and forty nights to find the old wizard and seek his help
and magical instruction, before my tourmented
soul becomes forever a werewulf.

SEQUELS/PREQUELS
Knightlore was the sequal to 2 games. These were Underwurlde and
Sabrewulf.  Alien8, among others, could also be regarded as a
sequal to Knightlore as it was the followup game from Ultimate
and used the same game engine, albeit improved.

GENERAL FACTS
Knightlore was, and still is regarded as a ground breaking piece
of software.  The game got rave reviews everywhere with people
bowled over with the graphics and new style of gameplay.
Apparently Chris and Tim Stamper, authors of the game were heard
to mention in a RARE (sorry about that!) interview that they had
the routine/game engine up and running for months and could have
released it BEFORE Sabre Wulf, but if they did that Sabre Wulf
wouldn`t have sold very well.  According to the Stampers, the
Spectrum world was just not ready for Knightlore until then.


NOTES
The game originally went on release back in 1984/85 at the price
of 9.99. Mastertronic bought the budget rights to the game, and
in 1987, released it on their 1.99 budget label, Ricochet.

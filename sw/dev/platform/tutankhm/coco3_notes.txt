Getting the roms into coco memory
=================================

Requires the following steps
1. getting raw bin files onto Coco DSK images
2. loading the bin files into high (banked) memory
3. saving the images as hi-loadable .BIN files

Getting the raw bin files onto Coco DSK images
----------------------------------------------

Easiest way is to use Portal-9.
1. Copy rom image file to Portal-9 "tutankham" project directory
2. Open files as project "bin" files (this adds them to the project)
3. Select type "", output filename "same"
4. Build project - this adds them to the DSK file.
5. By closing the file tabs, you can remove them from the project
   as they will no longer be required (replaced by hi-load versions)

Loading the bin files into high (banked) memory
-----------------------------------------------

10 Q=106496 <- pick an address to copy file data into
20 OPEN"D",#1,"ROMA000.BIN",1
30 FORG=1TOLOF(1):GET#1,G:LPOKEQ,PEEK(2441):Q=Q+1:NEXT
40 CLOSE

Use "LREADME.BAS" (as above) on virtual disk image.
Note: that by default, MMU is using (8KB) pages 48-63 for task 0,1.
Examples:
ROM $A000-$BFFF loaded to $1A000-$1BFFF (bank 13)
So Q=106,496
ROM $C000-$FFFF loaded to $1C000-$1FFFF (banks 14,15)
So Q=114,688
ROM $9000-$9FFF loaded to $19000-$19FFF (bank 12)
So Q=102,400

Saving the images as hi-loadable .BIN files
-------------------------------------------

Use "LSAVEM.BAS" (as supplied by sockmaster via email) on virtual disk image.
Choose 1) LSAVEM Utility
Choose start,end as below
Press <ENTER> for EXEC address.
Examples:
ROM $1A000-$1BFFF
start,end = 106496,114687
ROM $1C000-$1CFFF
start,end = 114688,131071
ROM $19000-$19FFF
start,end = 102400,106495

eg. MMU register for task 1, $6000-$7FFF at $FFA3 (65443)
so to check...
LOADM"ROM1A000.BIN" (this loads to $1A000)
poke 65443,13 (this maps bank 13 ($1A000) to $6000)
examine memory $6000 in MESS debug window

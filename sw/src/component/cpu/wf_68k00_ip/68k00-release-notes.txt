This IP core is the model of a (hopefully) 68000 compatible microprocessor. The core uses about 10.000 logic elements (Altera Cyclone II).

The core is in a working condition now with all implemented operations tested and compared with
the simulator tool IDE68K written by P.J. Fondse (thanks to him for the support). Not well tested
due to lack of hardware is the exception handler module (interrupts). This will change in the
near future.

Please send me an email to wf@inventronik.de if bugs are encountered or also for tips and
suggestions.

Known issues:
The function code outputs (FC) are coded in a way, that the patterns during the bus transfers meet the patterns of the original 68000 CPUs. If there is no bus transfer and the processor is the bus master, there results a funcion code of "000". If the processor has no control over the bus, the function code outputs are high impedant.

The deasserted bus control signals UDSn or LDSn produce during byte wide bus access and in the predecrement addressing mode short spikes. This behaviour do not affect the correct bus transfer.

The EXT operation in the operation type OP_68K00 is named EXTW due to compiler constraints with the Xilinx ISE.

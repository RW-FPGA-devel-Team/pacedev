Please mail me if you find errors, something is missign etc... (asalmi@ratol.fi)

V1.0 2000-10-19        first version (there must be errors)
V1.1 2000-11-03        tabs -> spaces, clean up, now normal text file (no MS-DOS), added LEA, stack writes
                       and interrupts.
V1.2 2000-11-30        fixed LBRA, LBSR cycles

NOTES:
#             is cycle nro
NNNN          is opcode location
VMA cycle     (Data Bus = Don't Care, Address Bus = FFFF)
EA            Effective Address

<h2>How to build PS/2 Wheel Mouse Controller</h2>

For beginning: from <b>version 1.4</b>, there is new version of hardware - but you can
still use your old hardware because of two new firmware versions.  Detailed description of
each of them with schemes and links to firmwares you can read <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/version.html">here</a>.
<p>

</p><h2>Part list</h2>

You will need at least following for building this controller:

<ul>
<li>PIC16F627 or PIC16F628
</li><li>DB-9 female connector - to Amiga side
</li><li>MiniDIN-6 female connector - to mouse side
</li><li>Some wires (or <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/pcb.html">PCB</a>)
</li></ul>

If you don't have PIC16F62x, or you want to modify existing PIC16F84-based controller
and anyway don't want to use 2-wheel mice or joystick simulation in future, you can still
use

<ul>
<li>PIC16F84 (PIC16F84A, or even old PIC16C84)
</li><li>4MHz crystal or ceramic resonator
</li></ul>

instead of PIC16F62x.  Current and all next versions of firmware anyway will support both
PICs.<p>

If you want to reduce cost of controller by approx. 2 USD, you can replace flash PIC by
OTP (One-Time-Programmable) PIC.  It may be one of following PICs: PIC16C554, PIC16C558,
PIC16C620, PIC16C621, PIC16C622 and some others.  Them are cheaper, but you can't update
firmware - you will need to replace PIC for that.  Additionally, there is no OTP PIC
programmers on Amiga now (June 2001), and you will need to program it elsewhere.</p><p>

Optionally, you may use following parts:

</p><ul>
<li>18pin socket for PIC - highly recommended for PIC &amp; firmware upgrades!<br>
(but you can install PIC16F627 even now and use in-circuit programming)
</li><li>Two 20pF capacitors - them are required if resonator doesn't start or start at wrong
frequency (and recommended - but in most cases not needed).
</li><li>0.1uF blocking capacitor in parallel with mouse power - recommended too, but not required.
</li><li>2k resistor - recommended for 4-button version.
</li><li>Second DB-9 female connector, if you want to use wheel and additional buttons.
</li><li>DB-9 connector cases (boxes)
</li></ul><p>

</p><h2>PIC programming</h2>

You can program PIC on existing programmer, or build my simple <b>devpic package</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>In case of programming PIC on existing programmer</b>, you must select following
options:
<table cellspacing="7">
<tbody><tr><td>OSC</td><td>=</td><td>HS</td></tr>
<tr><td>WDT</td><td>=</td><td>ON</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
That was parameters for all usable PICs including OTP, but not for PIC16F62x.  If you will
use PIC16F627 or PIC16F628, you must select following options:
<table cellspacing="7">
<tbody><tr><td>OSC</td><td>=</td><td>INTRC <b>without CLKOUT</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>WDT</td><td>=</td><td>ON</td></tr>
<tr><td>LVP</td><td>=</td><td>OFF</td></tr>
<tr><td>MCLRE</td><td>=</td><td>OFF (digital I/O or something similar)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Other options don't play any role.<p>
</p></li><li><b>In case of building devpic</b>,
<a href="ftp://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/dev/cross/devpic.lha">download it from Aminet</a>
and build it.  Devpic is a simple device on parallel port, based on one «glue
logic» chip and some resistors &amp; diodes.  One of useful devpic features is an
in-circuit programming - you can reprogram PIC for future versions <b>even in working
device</b> (but for some reason you must disconnect it from joyport during programming).<p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10"><tbody><tr><td>
Devpic will program <b>PIC16F84(A)</b> by following command:<p>
<b>picprog ps2m.hex force=16382</b>
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
For programming <b>PIC16F627</b> or <b>PIC16F628</b> you will use command:<p>
<b>picprog ps2m.hex force=16212 sf=2</b>
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;</p><p>

«FORCE» keyword describes configuration word, that contains configuration bits
like OSC and WDT (and also LVP &amp; MCLRE for PIC16F62x).  Normally it can be
«CW» keyword, but «FORCE» does also code deprotection if PIC was
protected.  Don't use that keywords when you update firmware - PIC remembers last
configword.  «SF» is «SmartFlash» mode of picprog, that speed ups
new PIC's programming up to 5 times in comparison with PIC16F84.</p><p>

OSC is an OSCillator mode (PIC can handle resonators or RC circuit), and WDT is WatchDog
Timer - it is an internal PIC circuit, that automatically resets it if it hangs.  WDT is
required for PS/2 controller - it is used in algorithm not only for exception cases, but
even for mouse waiting.  LVP is a Low Voltage Programming - in this mode programmer
doesn't need 12v, but we lose RB4 PIC pin.  MCLRE - purpose of MCLR pin, in our case it
works as general input pin (maybe useful in future versions).  If you don't want to
understand all this details - simply use string as described above.</p><p> If you had problems
with PIC programming - forget your old devpic archive, and try new devpic release (now
1.6) with v3 hardware, it is more stable than v2.</p><p> </p></li></ul>

<h2>Building of device</h2>

Finally select <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/version.html">hardware version</a>, and build it by schematic
diagrams.  Personally I don't use PCB, and I assemble it directly in DB-9 connector case
(see <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/index.html">photos</a> on front page of manual).  But if you want to
do PCB - there is a <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/pcb.html">reference PCB design</a>, done by Marc SAVART
[sil51#ifrance.com].  It is designed for use on A4000T (also you can see
<a href="ftp://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/hard/hack/ps2m_example.lha">photos archive</a> of
ready device).  I can't give any warranty for this PCB design, but now I manually check
every version for wrong connections :)<p>

</p><h2>Debugging</h2>

If assembled device doesn't work - there is a list of probable errors:

<ul>
<li>Incompatibility with your mouse - try another one
</li><li>Overloading of 4-button version (by optical mouse for example)
</li><li>Error in connections
</li><li>Erroneous PIC programming or incorrect configuration word
</li><li>Bad resonator (try to install 20pF capacitors)
</li></ul>

If you have oscilloscope - see signal at OSC pins (not for PIC16F62x).  Schematic diagram
is already tested and doesn't contain bugs.  There are tens of people that assembled and
use it now.<p>

</p><h2>Modifications</h2>

Probably it is a most interesting part of this manual :-)&nbsp; Because of open source you
can modify <a href="http://ps2m.sotchenko.ru/pic/ps2m.asm">source code</a><a> for your needs.  This source may be
recompiled by picasm assembler (you can find it in
</a><a href="ftp://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/dev/cross/devpic.lha">devpic package</a>).  There
is <b>macros.i</b> file, contains my favorite macro operators - it must be in current
directory for picasm with source file.  Usage of picasm is very simple:<p>

<b>picasm ps2m</b></p><p>

Both firmware versions may be generated from one source because of conditional asseymbly
usage.  POWER variable (see line <b>POWER equ</b>...) defines it - 0 value is a 5-button
version, and 1 value is a 4-button version.  SPEED variable allows you to use different
resonators, than 4MHz (see comment).</p><p>

Some comments about several program parts destination:
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th>Label</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>Interrupt handler - it is called every mouse clock (11 times per byte)
and eats approximately a half of 4MHz PIC speed.  After byte receiving, this routine
stores received byte in <b>recvdt</b> and sets flag <b>fbyte</b>.  These bytes are stored
in packet buffer in «main loop».</td></tr>

<tr><td>start<br>
start_a</td><td>
Init code.  Some details about mouse detection:
<ul>
<li>At first, there is Genius init sequence: <b>0xE8 0x03 0xE6 0xE6 0xE6 0xE9</b>.
After 0xE9 command mouse sends status bytes, or Genius NetScroll magic sequence <b>0x00
0x33 0x55</b>. In last case (it means that it is Genius NetScroll with 5 buttons),
controller uses Genius mode and skips next init sequences.
</li><li>At second, there is Microsoft init sequence: <b>0xF3 0xC8 0xF3 0x64 0xF3 0x50</b>.
After this, controller reads mouse ID (<b>0xF2</b>) and checks it for equivalence with
<b>3</b>.  If it is true - mouse is in Intellimouse mode now (wheel + 3 buttons).
</li><li>At third, there is new Microsoft init sequence: <b>0xF3 0xC8 0xF3 0xC8 0xF3 0x50</b>.
After this, controller reads mouse ID again and checks it for equivalence with
<b>4</b>.  If it is true - mouse is in Intellimouse Explorer mode now (wheel + 5 buttons).
If mouse ID still is 3 - it means that it is only Intellimouse - not Explorer.
</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>m_check</td><td>
It is a code, that will be executed after 2 seconds of mouse «silence».
It reads mouse status and sees stream mode flag.  If stream mode is disabled - this means
that mouse was reconnected.  In this case controller will reset it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>p_init</td><td>
Here is setting of initial values of «virtual sync serial port».
It is used mainly for «re-sync» if sync was lost due to electric
surge/noise (bit(s) was lost or unnecessary bit(s) was added).<p>
Additionally, this routine contains check for «alien» signal on LMB pin (for
example - second joystick «fire») and disable controller.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>schk</td><td>
This routine receives bytes in packet buffer (byte1-byte4). After this it sets <b>fpkt1</b>
flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>pchk1</td><td>
This routine will be called after receiving of full packet.  Because of controller is all
time in «main loop» simulates mouse movement, packet processing is done by
several parts.  It is a first part - processing of horisontal movement.  After processing
this routine sets flag for next routine (<b>fpkt2</b>), and without own flag (<b>fpkt1</b>)
it will not be processed again up to next packet receiving.<p>
Processing of movement contains calculating of mouse speed - movement will be done with
this speed.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>pchk2</td><td>
This routine is like previous, and it processes vertical movement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>pchk3</td><td>
This routine processes all mouse buttons (at first - standard three buttons),
and then it processes additional buttons and wheel (only if these were detected).</td></tr>
<tr><td>tchk</td><td>
It is a timer support.  Controller updates mouse signals only approx. 6000 times per
second.  If next 1/6000 of second doesn't approach yet, controller will return to checking
of next byte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>mchk</td><td>
It is a mouse checking - as described above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>xchk<br>ychk</td><td>
It is realtime update of movement counters with needed speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>zchk</td><td>
Wheel counter update.</td></tr>
<tr><td>xyout</td><td>
Movement counters and fourth button are simultaneously updated here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cpoff</td><td>
This subroutine enables controller, if it is disabled.  Additionally it sets counters in
default state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>testms</td><td>
Check for Microsoft protocol(s).  Both protocols are checked in one subroutine because of
similarity (one byte difference).</td></tr>
<tr><td>send</td><td>
Sending byte to mouse.  Because of rare nature of this action, it is not done by
interrupt engine (that also unloads interrupt routine from rare instructions).</td></tr>
<tr><td>bwait</td><td>
It is a waiting for byte from mouse.  Actually a byte receiving subroutine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>delayms<br>delayus</td><td>
Delays by milliseconds and fourt microseconds (in W).</td></tr>
